## Bootstrap info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). For information on working with CRA, refer to their documentation.

## Working with this site

To get the site working locally, clone the repo, then run `npm install` and, once all modules have been installed, run `npm run start` to run the site locally. There is an `npm run build` command which will build a deployment-ready version of the site.
